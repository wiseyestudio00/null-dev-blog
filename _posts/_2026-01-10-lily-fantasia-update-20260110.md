## Introduction

Before I know it, 3 months have passed since I last updated the dev blogs. What can I say? Ever since I entered my adulthood, time only seems to be moving faster and faster. I seem to lose my grip on time very easily. I apologize.

Good news is that Lily Fantasia is almost finished now. When I say "finished," I really do mean finished. Every system, animation, mechanics, dialogues, texts, localization, art, music are all set in-place. There are only a few bugs and quality of life improvements left. If

## Some Reminisces

Ever since I started working on Lily Fantasia, one question lingered in my mind: what is a story that only a rhythm game can tell? There are so many rhythm games with their own narratives, but almost none of their stories NEED to be told through a rhythm game.

To be precise, I don't mean they aren't good stories. but rather if those stories were their own standalone visual novels, would anything be lost? The answer is often disappointing: no. What's more disappointing is that the stories are often not about music at all! They can be sci-fi, fantasy, grand or small, epic or slice-of-life, but so common are the stories not related to its gameplay, and not related to music either.

Is a rhythm game story just something forcefully jammed into a rhythm game, just to give the players something to put their mind off to in-between songs?

It is not to say that there is no rhythm game that has achieved what I said. The best to ever do it was the original Deemo. It really was a story that only a rhythm game can tell. I think it will deserve its own blog analyzing Deemo, but to put it simply: I like how Deemo combines its gameplay, narrative driven environmental explorasion. Its presentation so elegant, the premise so simple, but every part of that game is essential. There is no fat to trim. And most importantly, the gameplay, environment, and the story all influence each other's designs so well.

I sometimes wonder if Rayark intentionally set out to make a story that only a rhythm game can tell with Deemo, or they just wanted to create something beautiful, and everything falls in place. Anyhow, it is something that will be hard to surpass artistically.

A few other honorable mentions in this category (narrative-driven rhythm game with a narrative that only a rhythm game can tell) include:
- Rhythm Doctor
- Lanota
- Unbeatable, possibly. I haven't played it, but from what I heard, the story should fit the gameplay very well.

I want to emphasize that I am not saying rhythm games that don't fit this criteria are bad. It will be like saying all action games should be about Kung-Fu. It's just something that I feel strongly passionate about: to combine games and stories and create new experiences. It's the motto of the studio that I wrote down 4 years ago, afterall.

And so, the goal with Lily Fantasia has always been to create a narrative that only a rhythm game can tell. Not only that, it will deliver an experience that all future rhythm games which want to include a narrative have to think deep and hard: "how will we create something better than Lily Fantasia?"

Why am I bringing this up now? Because now the game is finished, and I look at one part, specifically a 5 minute segment, I can finally judge if I achieved what I set out to do. I think back the the last three years, which, as you can imagine, hadn't treated me kindly. I played that 5 minute segment through and through, and think about how time and time again, I failed myself and how I let people down. How much I have sacraficed just to make these 5 minutes and how it didn't have to be like this.

Do I think it was worth it? Thankfully this time I don't have to judge myself, as you can judge it for me when the game comes out.
