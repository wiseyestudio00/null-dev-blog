# Life Update
I went for a haircut for the first time in......I think half a year? I had purposefully left my hair uncut for so long because I want to perm my hair for the first time. What I did not expect is that the hair perm took FOUR hours to finish. That's probably more than all the time I have ever spent on haircuts combined. The good news is that I probably do look the best I have ever looked, and there isn't really a bad news. So that's it!

# Demo Update
So the big Demo update of Lily Fantasia is (very likely) released next week. It won't really contain any "new content," but there are many Quality of Life updates (although I think those are really just missing necessary features). Usually I just put them into a LONG list and just post them, but I guess I should record them here just to show the work.

## The Back (Return) button has been changed to X
I thought I was SOOOO smart when I set the back button to left-shift. The original idea was that the player can navigate the menu with just their left hand alone (WASD to Move, Space to Confirm, Shift to Return). To be fair, this is still a genius idea until I realized the players can't screenshot because they can't press Shift.

Anyway, yeah.

## (Greatly) Reduce Game Size on Disk
Let me show the screenshots because it's kinda awesome I can't lie.

Before:

After:
![Size After](size_after.png)

I don't remember how, but I actually talked to one of the developers who worked on Subnautica? Or at least someone referred me to one of his videos and I talked to him briefly on a separate occasion (I am sure I did not leave any lasting impression). Whatever, what I want to say is that video helped me so greatly it feels like I just relearned everything. Anyway, I learned about how to properly manage assets, and also readjusted almost all sprites in the game so they are properly compressed. So now the game only takes 600 mb instead of 1.6 GB!

## Pop-Up Tutorial(s)
First of all, the Pop-Up message menus are greatly improved. Again, let me show you a before and after screenshot.

Before:

After:
![Pop Up Tutorial Before](popup_tutorial_after.JPG)

Just better by all metrics I would say.

Also, now when you enter some interfaces or trigger a specific action, a tutorial would pop up to tell you important information. To be fair, I think for 80% of the player-base (whom I assume are already rhythm game players), they probably don't need to read the tutorials, but since this is a game that aims to be "professional (as in, it's for everyone not just the gamers)," I think I need to emphasize proper player guidance. 

## Lily Power
I already talked about Lily Power in great details [here](https://wiseyestudio00.github.io/null-dev-blog/posts/lily-power-pt1/), so just read that!

## Special Effects on locked songs
Along with the addition of Lily Power, now some songs will be locked at start. When they are locked, their visuals will be greyed, and they will sound muffled, too. (They will become clear again once you unlocked them!)

## Updated Story Book Menu
Not only does the Story Book gets a much needed visual [overhaul](https://wiseyestudio00.github.io/null-dev-blog/posts/story-book-animation-improvement/), but there will be a new BGM just for this menu! I spent so much money for so many details!

## Skipping the tutorial
This only happens once for most players, but now when you enter the tutorial song, you will see an option to skip it when you pause the song.

## Improved the Special Mode Intro at the start of songs
By Special Mode, I meant the songs like The Wolf, The Moon, and My Will with health bar (aka additional challenge on top on the song). At the start of those songs, an intro animation displaying information about the Special Mode is played.

Like this:

I improved the animation a bit:

Personally I think it definitely fits the game's aesthetic a lot better, but it may need further improvements.

There will be other Special Modes in the future!

## Lily "Conduct" Animation Intro
Along with the update to Special Mode Intro Animation, I added an intro animation where Lily will appear and do a little "conduct" movement!

*She will only appear after you meet her in the story, so make sure you progress the story!

## New and Updated sprites in Visual Novel
Lily gets a whole new "battle" sprite and neat effects, and some backgrounds are updated too!

## Bug Fixes: Crashes in Eastern European languages
The game used to crash (or soft-lock) during certain visual novel segments. Fixed!

# Conclusion
That's it! There are a lot more miscellaneous details I did not bother to show here though. In general, I think this Demo will be about the "same quality" as the final product. The final product would just have  Hopefully the update will drop next week. If you want to, you can manually enable this update on Steam already, too! (See Announcement channel on Discord)

# Today's food for thought
If men are not supposed to walk the path of self-destruction and push away everyone they love, why do they look so cool while doing that hmmm???
