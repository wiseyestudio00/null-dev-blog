# Introduction
Hi, this is NULL speaking. I am a game developer and the founder of Wiseye Studio. I mainly work as the head-programmer. In the future, I hope to delegate some of my works, but currently I am also the project manager, social media manager and writer.

 I am currently working on our 2 titles, the sci-fi themed mobile rhythm game Hexa Hysteria (2022), and the piano-themed fantasy PC rhythm game Lily Fantasia (planned-to-release in 2025).

Besides creating games, I also like to read and write novels.

This blog was created to explore the development process of Lily Fantasia. However, it may also dubbed as my personal journal, and I will sometimes just talk about whatever I want to talk about.

# 13 Fun Facts
I will now list 13 FUN facts about myself so you will know me better, but I think that would reveal too much about myself and that would be boring. So of the 13 facts below, 2 of them are just LIES. You will have to decide which ones are the lies! Good Luck!

1. My favoriate manga is Delicious in Dungeon.
2. I have commited 5 truly punishable crimes by law. One of them was on accident. One of them may have been a felony under US jurisdiction system.
3. Doki Doki Literature Club and Undertale inspired me to make games.
4. I love seeing confident, beautiful men cry in complete hopelessness.
5. My favoriate scene in all of anime is when [Vetega pointed to Trunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNrFpSiYNpY) and said "*Allow me to introduce you to my son. His name is Trunks. He too is a true SUPER SAIYAN. He's not quite as strong as I am, but it would be hard to tell the difference between us.*" and then semi-perfect Cell just freaked out. Funniest shit I have ever seen.
6. Programming Language legend [Tom Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare) called the Null Reference [the Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/), which is also why I give myself the nickname NULL: a very expensive mistake.
7. I have beaten Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro and Elden Ring.
8. I live with 2 other people. However, you can also say I live alone because those 2 people are imaginary and don't actually exist (I know you are lying to me and I perceive reality as I like it to be.)
9.  I was 24 and 6 months old when I wrote this sentence down (2025/01/15).
10. I talked to myself more in the past 3 years more than all other human interactions I have had in my life combined.
11. I believe one's natural talent doesn't really contribute that much in developing a skill. With enough focus, effort and good learning structure, one can probably learn any skill they set their mind to. Unforunately, most people completely lack the ability to properly learn and have enough standard and judgement toward themsevles so they will never truly excel at anything (I am not excluding myself when I say this; I am most people).
12. I have once slept for 36 hours straight because I just don't find any reason to be awake.
13. I can hold my breath for 2 minutes straight, and I am confident I can pull a 2:30 if I have time to prepare.
14. I think society would be better if our technology was stuck around somewhere along the 1990s to early 2000s, arguably maybe 1980s when Internet hadn't come around. The human brain clearly can not handle whatever we have now.

# Work History and Skills
I developed Hexa Hysteria when I was in university and released it just after I graduated. I worked in Meta after for a short period of time, but I got laid off very soon, before my on-boarding period even finished (to no fault of my own; the stock was just underperforming). I got a bit disillusioned and decided to just do my own things.

Currently, I would describe myself as semi-proficient in the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/). I only call myself semi-proficient because I don't really think I am a good programmer. At most, I am experienced in it, but I doubt my ability to solve hard problems in Unity, and I am not a hugely low-level developer. I believe I can realistically create any primitive game in Unity, but to create a game readily commercial......it would take me a long time.

I can also write in Python, although that's not my main language. I created the moderation bot on the Lily Fantasia's Discord server and other automation-tools mainly to reduce my workload.

# Hobby
Like I mentioned, I like writing stories. But I am not very good at it either. I personally wrote all the stories in Hexa Hysteria and Lily Fantasia. If you hate / love them, that's on me!

I have also participated in other writing activities......but I am keeping them secrets now!

I also like playing video games, although my time often run short. My favoriate game from 2022 was Inscryption.

# That's it!
That's enough about me! Honestly, I don't think there is much to talk about myself. I am a boring person. I don't really have a life besides creating games. Unfortunately, what I create is probably more interesting than who I am.

In the next dev-blog, I will start talking about Health-Bar. Go read that instead! Bye bye!
