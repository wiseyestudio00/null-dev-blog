# Intro
Before we start, I will would like to talk about a recent incident in my life.

As you already knew, I prided myself to be the Best Spaghetti Eater in town. There was only 1 good Spaghetti restaurant within walking distance where I lived, and I (<- a 24-year-old man-child who lived alone, didn't cook, was still a basic carbon live-form that needed food to live on>) often went there for dinner.

When I did go, I was always the only customer who went alone. The waiter (with a slight hint of disgust) would seat me somewhere close to the window where the tables are small. I would order the same set of soup, salad, dessert and Spaghetti for myself, which would be the French Onion Soup, Caeser Salad, their home-made Pudding, and the White Wine Clam Pasta. The choices may seem basic, but of all the other different combinations of Soup, Salad, Dessert, and Spaghetti, I knew for certain this was the best combination. So I would go 1 outta 3 days, and order the same set. I knew I was the Best Spaghetti Eater in town.

Things changed last weekend, when I went alone as usual. I got seated to the windows as usual. I ordered my set, and stared out of the window to look cool. It truly felt so good being the Best Spaghetti Eater in town.

That was when another man walked into the restaurant. I looked to the door in disbelief. The man was dressed better, looked better, and was overall the better social man than I was. I was in ultimate unease.

The man was seated next to me. I tried to be cool and avoided eye contact, but I could feel my heart pounding. Was he the challenger that was always prophesied years ago by the Witch? The one who would dethrone me as the Best Spaghetti Eater in town? I watched the waiter came to take in his order. I was in utter distress. The world was looking upon us. This was the moment in my life, what would define me for years to come.

The man ordered the *exact* same soup, salad, and dessert as I did. I got more nervous with each order. When he ordered the home-made Pudding, I was already to stand up and finish him off before he could complete his order. The last second felt like an entire year. I stared at them in complete hopelessness as he completed his order......

He ordered Spaghetti alla Nerano, which was not my White Wine Clam Pasta. He did not achieve the best combination.

Sweat coming down on my spine, I let out a breath of relief. I should have known there was no way another Spaghetti Eater could have bested me. I would always be the Best Spaghetti Eater. That who I was, and who I needed to be. The man was a fool, so was the Witch. I would remain *King*.

The food came, and we ate in silence. I finished sooner because I did come in sooner. When the man was finishing his home-mad Pudding, I stood up and went to check out my bill. The waiter came to the counter to take my bill.

As she took my credit card, I glanced outside, compelled by something I couldn’t explain. I looked outside the restaurant out from the front door.

The outside was already cold and dark. The sun had come down complete. A single street light was the only thing that separate us from the complete darkness, from men to the beasts.

The light was flickering. It was lonely. And one day, the darkness will defeat it, just like how it would crush the rest of us. The night would fall upon us, equally.

Just then, I finally understood. The truth that was always there, I just couldn't see......no, I just couldn't accept it.

If I had to be the Best Spaghetti Eater in town, then I did not deserve the be the Best Spaghetti Eater.

Tears rained down of my cheeks. The waiter was so scared seeing me cry that she was about to let out a small scream, but before she could say anything, I turned back and rushed to the man's table. I tapped on his shoulder, and he turned to me in confusion.

"You have bested me. For now on, you are the one and only the Best Spaghetti Eater in town." I told him, voice trembling.

The man nervously said "Huh? What? What did you say?" But I knew for a fact he understood me and my soul. He was already a brother to me.

I stepped outside the restaurant into the night's darkness, and went home alone. I might no longer be the Best Spaghetti Eater in town, but I had become something so much more than that.

So yeah that was my complete Spaghetti Eater arc anyway let's talk about localizaiton in Lily Fantasia.

# Localization
I am a perfectionist, or I should say I try to be one. However, as the saying goes, the cost to achieve perfection is infinite. So in reality I don't really strike for perfection, I just hyperfixate on the 20% little details that don't matter for 99% of the playerbase while leaving 80% of really important issues unfixed.

Anyway, let's see how I hyperfixate on some translations and wordplay in the game, so far.

First of all, I should mention I did not handle all of the translation myself. Our kind publishers Justdan handled most of them, and I gotta say I think they did a good job. However, sometimes there are just some hard-to-translate words that I have to figure something out.

# Special Terms / Portmanteau
Most of those hard-words are portmanteau or special terms. For example, in the story, there are 2 different worlds, 常世 and 異界. If we take these words literally, they would mean "the normal world" and "the weird/different realm" (although they sound a bit more cool in Chinese).

For 常世, the translator suggested "Mortal Realm," which I do think sounds cool and close enough. However, for 異界, the original translation was Otherworld, which isn't WRONG per say, but I just feel like the terms is overused in anime. Also, it brings up another question, how would we translate related-terms to English?

For example, in the story, it was mentioned 異種族 (Elseworlders) come from the Elseworld to the Mortal Realm. If we are taking it literally, 異種族 would translate to "Different Races" in English. It was meant to be a umbrella terms for all of the different mythical creatures and races from the Elseworld. If we had used "Otherworld," following the logic, 異種族 would be translated into "Otherworlders."

However, "Otherworlder" is often used in anime to refer to humans who are transported to the other world, not the other way around. I feel like that would create some confusions for the English Reader, and the terms just don't sound cool enough and are kind of overused. So I digged around other fantasy books and found the term "Elsecallers" from the Stromlight Archive serires. I thought it sounds cool and unfamiliar enough, so I adopted the prefix "Else," made new terms "Elseworld / Elseworlders" and suggested it to the translator......

All was well until I found out DC comics was already using the term "Elseworlds," but by then it's already too late......Elseworld it is.

Another term that really got me was 狼人, the Wolfman. The original translation was Werewolf, and I then realized, there are 2 kinds of man-wolf in fictions. The first one is the kind who are mostly human most of the time, and only transform under a full moon. The second one is the kind that doesn't transform, but is always Wolf-Man hybrid.

In the story, the Wolfman is the second kind. Obviously, Werewolf won't work because...the word "Were" implies the transformation, yeah? So I set myself to find the term that describes the second kind of Wolf-Man, and ended up...finding nothing. Wolfman, Werewolf, Lycanthrope...all meant the kind of Wolf-Man that transforms. There is no special term for the second kind. I got really frustrated and ultimately gave up and used the term Wolfman. If there is a special term, please let me know!

# Puns
Are are some puns in the story, especially in the character's names department. Usually, I am terrible at naming characters, and often fallback to generic names. However, this time I did actually spend time figuring some names out.

For example, Lily's full name has a pun in it. Her full name (never mentioned in game lmaooo) is Lilith Itera Batonné. This one is much easier to explain: Batonné as in Baton, as in the [baton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(conducting)) that conductors use.

The Main Character's name  is 鍵太 比亞野 Kenji Hiano. 比亞野 (Hiano) is a pun for piano. However, another pun that was lost in the English translation was 鍵太, which literally translate something like "keys (as in the keys on the piano)-taro."

There will be at least one other character who has a similiar pun in their name.

# Graphics
This category I actually did not have much input. However, one trouble that we did have was creating the logo of the game.

First, our graphic and UI designer helped created the original English logo.

![en logo](Logo_LilyFantasia_EN.png)

I actually thought it may be okay to use the logo for all languages. After all, if I were to localize the logo for each version of the game......It will be more work, such as having to make sure the interfaces all display correctly in all languages. However, our fan Andreko helped created the Chinese version of the logo as below.

![tc logo](Logo_LilyFantasia_TC.png)

It looks great, and by this time, we have contracted with our publisher, who provided the Japanese logo.

![jp logo old](Logo_LilyFantasia_JP_Old.png)

You may notice something isn't quite right with this logo if you have seen the real logo in game. However, can you spot what's different? I will give you 3 seconds to find the difference!

3...2...1...

...........Did you actually wait 3 seconds? Or did you just skim through it, not even attempting to find the difference? I am disappointed in you if you didn't. Just saying.

The difference is that one of the sia is filled in the final version.

![jp logo](Logo_LilyFantasia_JP.png)

I thought it would make sense if one of the sia is filled, as it symoblizes the Black and the White Notes in game, so I suggested it to the publisher, who made the changes accordingly.

# Conclusion
Yep, localization is pretty hard. Who could have known? For each language supported, it's like I am having 1.5x the work to do! I hate this! We should have all adopted to use Esperanto when we had the chance!

Anyway, tune in next time where I reveal my secret special ability to shoot lasers out of my eyes! See ya!
