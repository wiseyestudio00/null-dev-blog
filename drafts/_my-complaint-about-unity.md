# Life Update
I have been playing The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- recently. It is really good. However, during one play session, I accidently loaded an old save instead of saving my current playthrough, so I lost hours of progress. I may have cried a little bit. Why does the Load screen look exactly the same as the Save screen? UI designers worldwide, it's time to differentiate your Save and Load screens! The two menus that serve the exact opposite functionalities can not look the same! Color-tint them or whatever!

# MY COMPLAINT ABOUT UNITY
THE CAPITALIZATION IS NOT A MISTAKE. I AM SCREAMING THROUGHOUT THIS BLOG.

## INCONSISTENCY ON MOUSE AND GAMEPAD BEHAVIOR WHEN CLICKING ON A BUTTON

WHEN A UI BUTTON IS "CLICKED" BY A MOUSE, THE ONCLICK EVENT IS TRIGGERED WHEN THE MOUSE IS RELEASED. HOWEVER, WHEN IT IS "CLICKED" BY A GAMEPAD OR KEYBOARD, THE EVENT IS TRIGGERED WHEN IT IS PRESSED (AKA, IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE A BUTTON OR SPACE KEY IS PRESSED), NOT WHEN IT IS RELEASED. WHY?! WHY?! IS IT INCONSISTENT?! IT SHOULD BE TRIGGERED WHEN THE SPACE KEY IS RELEASED TOO!

## SCRIPTABLEOBJECT NEEDS SYSTEM.SERIALIZABLE OR CREATEASSETMENU

WHEN YOU INHERIT A SCRIPTABLEOBJECT, YOU NEED TO TAG IT WITH CREATEASSETMENU TO BE ABLE TO SPAWN IT IN EDITOR. LIKE THIS:

```CSharp
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Data", menuName = "ScriptableObjects/SpawnManagerScriptableObject", order = 1)]
public class SpawnManagerScriptableObject : ScriptableObject
{
    public string prefabName;

    public int numberOfPrefabsToCreate;
    public Vector3[] spawnPoints;
}
```

FAIR ENOUGH. HOWEVER, WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS THAT IF YOU REMOVE THE CREATEASSETMENU TAG AFTER THE SCRIPTABLEOBJECT IS SPAWNED, THE SCRIPTABLEOBJECT WOULD BREAK. IT WILL SAY THE ASSOCIATED SCRIPT IS NOT FOUND AND YOU NEED TO FIX THE COMPILE ISSUE. TURNS OUT YOU NEED TO HAVE THE CREATEASSETMENU OR SYSTEM.SERIALIZABLE TAG TO MAINTAIN THE SPAWNED SCRIPTABLE.

I WASTED HOURS ON THIS!!!!!

IT IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE DOCUMENTATION. IT IS BARELY MENTIONED ONLINE. WHY?! WHY?! WHY!????

## ADDRESSABLES ARE TOO POORLY DOCUMENTED AND BUGGY

I DO NOT KNOW HOW ANYONE IS SUPPOSED TO LEARN HOW TO USE ADDRESSABLES. THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION IS HORRIBLE. IT IS SO MUCH HARDER TO USE VS RESOURCES. I ADMIT IT IS BETTER THAN ASSETBUNDLE, BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE ADVERTISED AS THE "EASY TO USE AND THE ULTIMATE NEXT STEP OF ASSET MANAGEMENT" LIKE THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION SAYS! NO BEGINNER CAN FIGURE IT OUT!

## ADDRESSABLES ARTIFACTS ARE NOT INDEPENDENT BY PLATFORM

AKA, WHEN YOU BUILD ON A WINDOWS MACHINE VS A MAC, THE ARTIFACTS (BUILT RESULTS) OF ADDRESSABLES ARE DIFFERENT. WTF?! IT SHOULD BE 100% INDEPENDENT BY PLATFORM! WHY IS IT DIFFERENT?! HOW CAN IT BE DIFFERENT?!

## IT IS SO EXPENSIVE

OKAY. SO I PAY FOR THE PROFESSIONAL LICENSE, RIGHT. IT IS 2400 USD PER YEAR FOR ONE PERSON. WHAT!? HEXA HYSTERIA DOES NOT MAKE 2400 USD PER YEAR AT ITS PEAK! YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT I AM A RICH ASSHOLE; OTHERWISE, I WOULD BE PIRATING IT!

## URP IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT

IT IS NOT FINISHED WHEN IT IS RELEASED. IT IS NOT FINISHED NOW. WHEN YOU CLAIM PEOPLE SHOULD MIGRATE FROM BUILT-IN TO URP, IT SHOULD MEAN URP CAN DO EVERYTHING BUILT-IN CAN ALREADY DO! GUESS WHAT, IT DOESN'T. NOT EVEN BY A LONG MILE. WHEN I STARTED USING IT 2 YEARS AGO, A CAMERA COULDN'T EVEN PRINT TRANSPARENT COLOR ON SCREEN! HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO LAYER 2 CAMERAS WHILE BOTH OF THEM ARE MAIN? NO WAY! GUESS YOU SHOULD GO SCREW YOURSELF NOW!

ALSO, THERE WAS NO WAY TO CREATE A FULLSCREEN EFFECT BY SHADER LIKE IN BUILT-IN! NO EASY WAY AT LEAST! WHAT?! THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS PEOPLE DO WITH A CAMERA, YOU DUMBASS.

AND NOW THE URP IS FINALLY KINDA USEABLE, THEY ANNOUCE THE NEW UNIFIED PIPELINE. THE ONLY THING THAT IS UNIFIED IS MY RAGE AND SADNESS AGAINST YOU! I WILL BRING AN END TO THIS! TO MYSELF! EVEN IF IT COSTS ME EVERYTHING!

## THERE IS NO SUPPORT
UNITY DOES NOT HAVE SUPPORT, OKAY? OPENING A TICKET? PREPARE GET A REPLY AFTER A WEEK ASKING FOR. WHAT DO YOU THINK GAME-DEVELOPMENT IS?! I CAN NOT WAIT A WEEK!

## CLOUD BUILD DOES NOT WORK

UNITY HAS A CLOUD BUILD SERVICE. BUT IT REALLY SHOULD BE NAMED A DISSERVICE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK. IT BUILDS 20 TIMES LONGER ON THE CLOUD VS MY MACHINE, AND DON'T GET ME MENTIONED ABOUT AUTO-UPLOAD ADDRESSABLES. IT DOES NOT WORK. I NEVER WORKED. IT CAN NOT UPLOAD MY BUILT ADDRESSABLES ONTO UNITY'S OWN CDN. I HAD TO WRITE AN ENITRE UPLOAD-PIPELINE SCRIPT AND DO WHATEVEVER CRAZY REST API IT PROVIDES. AND THEN? THEY CHANGED THE API. NOW I HAVE TO REWRITE EVERYTHING. THE FIRST VERSION WORKED PERFECTLY FINE! WHY! WHY! CRY!

## I CAN'T FALL ASLEEP

OKAY THIS ONE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH UNITY I JUST WANT TO COMPLAIN THAT I CAN NOT FALL ASLEEP NOWADAYS. I HAVE TO TAKE A SLEEPING PILL EVERYDAY TO FALL ASLEEP, AND I BODY IS BUILDING UP TOLERANCE AND I FEEL LIKE SOON I WILL NEED TO TAKE 2 INSTEAD OF JUST 1! PILL ME!

# I am sad now.

I am not done. I just wrote down what I had to deal with for the last week. Unity has brought me untold damage to my health, my sanity, and my integrity as a person. However, most importantly, it is actually me who has done the stabbing to my life. Unity only brought the knife to the table. I am the one who grabs it and hurts myself. And also I am not talking about Unity anymore.
