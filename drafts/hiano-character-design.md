# Life Update
I recently heard about the book "House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski from a YouTube video. I haven't read it, but the concept is that the story is not told in a linear fashion, but instead composed of several incomplete manuscripts, broken paragraphs, and all in all much like a modern ARG. I have always been interested in these non-linear story (you can probably tell from the stories in Hexa Hysteria), so I bought the book from Amazon and have it sent to me internationally, which is half-way across the globe.

I received the book within 5 days, including the weekend.

Of course, I am very excited to be able to read the book so fast, but I can't help but be kind of worried. Should I be able to receive a book transfer internationally within a week? Is this too convenient? Are we the consumers acting upon our mortal desires, or have our desires consumed us? Father, do you not see the Elfking? The Elfking with his crown and cape?

Anyway, let's talk about the main character's design in Lily Fantasia.

# Main Character
His name is Kenji Hiano. Since the very start, we were going for a very anime-y story. It makes a lot of sense to have the main character to be a high-schooler.

^ He did not go through a lot of big changes. It's mostly details.

As for "styles," we wanted the world to be more colorful (playful?) to fit the anime-vibe. Tha's why I asked the artist to add some blueness to his hair. It's kind of like characters from Triggers, the anime studio.

^ The details are pretty subtle, but did you notice his sleeves have piano patterns on them?

I also asked the piano bracelet. It makes sense for the magic piano to go somewhere when they are not shown explicitly, so the magic piano becomes the bracelet when they are retracted.

Personally I like how much piano-elements Hiano has on his clothes.

This is a pretty short one, so let me provide some other drafts for his battle stance.

^ I think I asked for more "magic glow." Blue and Gold go well together.

# Final Thoughts
My son, it is a streak of fog.
