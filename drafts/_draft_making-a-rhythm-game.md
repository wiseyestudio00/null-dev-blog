# Rule 1: DO NOT MAKE A COMMERCIAL RHYTHM GAME
I understand it doesn't sound sincere coming from a guy who had made 1 rhythm game and is currently making another, but please, if you are inexperience in making games, just don't.

I know these kind of posts are supposed to sound all flowery and optimistic, saying sh*t like "oh just chase your dream," "just do what you want," "if anything you will still get experience from it."

F**k that romanticism bullsh*t. I am here to be truthful about my experience, okay? And let's just say, that experience is not good, okay? It's actually really really bad and it turned me into this person who is writing down this sentence, okay?

In short, you have a 99.99% failure rate. You will have to make the ball hit red 10 times in a roll. Realistically impossible.

Why shouldn't you make a rhythm game as your first game?

- The market is niche
- Highly competitive (especially on mobile)
- People are not THAT willing to spend money, especially not on their main-game
- Surprisingly technical and hard to make
- It's VERY DIFFERENT from all other kinds of games; your skills are not going to transfer to other genre
- Costly to make, if you are paying for the rights to use the songs and arts without lowballing the artists
- You may think you can, but you will not be able to consistently push out songs (contents) over a long period of time. You just won't, especially when you are failing, which you will be.
- Other hundred differnt reasons. But I decided to stop writing at this point because I notice I am actually becoming insane at this point.

That said, if you just want to make a game, and you don't expect commercial success. You just want to build a community, have fun with talented firends......Let's just say you will be able to do all those with other projects, but whatever.

The only I think ask of you is to ask you don't expect success. That's all.

# 2. Before You Starts......
## 2.1 Make sure you are in a mentally stable state
Haha, let's just say when I started 4 years ago, I was not mentally stable, and it blocked me from making good decisions. Take some time, really sit down, calculate the numbers, see what you will need to make in order to be balanced. Just please, really really think about this without your dreams and hopes get in the way.

## Don't try to make Phigros 2
You are not going to one-up Phigros in terms of the chart complicity, rookie. Just focus you have a solid foundation and go from there.

## Don't make a complicated story
Story with complicated layers and lore? Fucking interesting, I love those. But having complicated stories means you will NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE PLOT THREADS MEAN SOMETHING TO THE PLAYERS. You will NEED TO PUT THOSE STORIES OUT.

People are NOT going to notice your genius hidden little lore details unless you tell them, okay? Only the most niche, smallest percentages of players will care. Most players just care about the songs and the charts, which is like, actually fair enough. This is a rhythm game not Fate/Stay Night the visual novel. 

Fuck me. You know what? I actually prepared the FUCKING BEST STORIES I have ever written for Hexa Hysteria. Did I get to put those out? NO! It hurts me so bad that I want to cry that I never got to show the stories. I am actually crying as I write these down. Whatever, I deserve this for betraying myself.

Just focus on making a cute anime girl moscots with a unique style, seriouslly. Having a good looking character goes a long way.

# Make sure you can fail
As in, make sure you won't be homeless and jobless when you fail. Don't clear your savings to make a game. Don't give up your education to make a game. Please refer to Rule 1 and remember YOU WILL FAIL.

# 3. As you are developing...
## Don't get emotionally attach to your games
You are not your games. Or at least you don't have to be. Once you attach your self-worth to your creation, you will only find out how worthless you are.

## Give up if it doesn't feel right
Sometimes you can just feel it. Your heart telling you that it's not going to make it. You look at the numbers and they just don't match up. You do some calculations
