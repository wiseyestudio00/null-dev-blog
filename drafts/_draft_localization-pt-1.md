I am a perfectionist, or I should say I try to be one. However, as the saying goes, the cost to achieve perfection is infinite. So in reality I don't really strike for perfection, I just hyperfixate on the 20% little details that don't matter for 99% of the playerbase while leaving 80% of really important issues unfixed.

Anyway, let's see how I hyperfixate on some translations and wordplay in the game, so far.

First of all, I should mention I did not handle all of the translation myself. Our kind publishers Justdan handled most of them, and I gotta say I think they did a good job. However, sometimes there are just some hard-to-translate words that I have to figure something out.
# Special Terms / Portmanteau
Most of those hard-words are portmanteau or special terms. For example, in the story, there are 2 different worlds, 常世 and 異界. If we take these words literally, they would mean "the normal world" and "the weird/different realm" (although they sound a bit more cool in Chinese).

For 常世, the translator suggested "Mortal Realm," which I do think sounds cool and close enough. However, for 異界, the original translation was Otherworld, which isn't WRONG per say, but I just feel like the terms is overused in anime. Also, it brings up another question, how would we translate related-terms to English?

For example, in the story, it was mentioned 異種族 (Elseworlders) come from the Elseworld to the Mortal Realm. If we are taking it literally, 異種族 would translate to "Different Races" in English. It was meant to be a umbrella terms for all of the different mythical creatures and races from the Elseworld. If we had used "Otherworld," following the logic, 異種族 would be translated into "Otherworlders." However, "Otherworlder" is often used in anime to refer to humans who are transported to the other world, not the other way around. I feel like that would create some confusions for the English Reader, and the terms just don't sound cool enough and are kind of overused. So I digged around other fantasy books and found the term "Elsecallers" from the Stromlight Archive serires. I thought it sounds cool and unfamiliar enough, so I adopted the prefix "Else," made a new term "Elseworld" and suggested it to the translator......

All was well until I found out DC comics was already using the term "Elseworlds," but by then it's already too late......Elseworld it is.

Another term that really got me was 狼人, the Wolfman. The original translation was Werewolf, and I then realized, there are 2 kinds of man-wolf in fictions. The first one is the kind who are mostly human most of the time, and only transform under a full moon. The second one is the kind that doesn't transform, but is always Wolf-Man hybrid.

In the story, the Wolfman is the second kind. Obviously, Werewolf won't work because...the word "Were" implies the transformation, yeah? So I set myself to find the term that describes the second kind of Wolf-Man, and ended up...finding nothing. Wolfman, Werewolf, Lycanthrope...all meant the kind of Wolf-Man that transforms. There is no special term for the second kind. I got really frustrated and ultimately gave up and used the term Wolfman. If there is a special term, please let me know!

# Puns
Are are some puns in the story, especially in the character's names department. Usually, I am terrible at naming characters, and often fallback to generic names. However, this time I did actually spend time figuring some names out.

Most notable is Main Character's name, 鍵太 比亞野 Kenji Hiano. Of course, 比亞野 (Hiano) is a pun for piano. However, another pun that was lost in the English translation was 鍵太, which literally translate something like "keys (as in the keys on the piano)-taro."

There will be one other character who has a similiar pun in their name.

# Graphics
This category I actually did not have much input.

# Conclusion
Yep, localization is pretty hard. Who could have known? For each language supported, it's like I am having 1.5x the work to do! I hate this! We should have all adopted to use Esperanto when we had the chance!

Anyway, tune in next time where I reveal my special ability to shoot lasers out of my eyes! See ya!
