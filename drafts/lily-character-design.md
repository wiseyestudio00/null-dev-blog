# Life Update
I place my work desk right in front of the window because I thought I can get for sunlight this way. When I lift my eyes out from the screen, I would stare out of the window, and see the apartment complex that's right cross the street.

On Thursday, when I was working on the story, I procrastinated again and looked out from the window. This was when I saw a young girl, standing on a chair, waist over the fence of the balcony. By all accounts, it seemed she was about to jump.

I completely froze, and my stress level shot through the roof. I lived on the third floor, judging by my eye-sight, she was probably on the fifth floor. If she were to jump, I was certain she would die.

Should I call the police? What's the police going to do anyway? Should I intervene?

Just when I was stressing out, she stepped down, adjusted something that's also on the fence of the balcony, and stepped onto the chair again. This went on a few more times.......turned out she was probably just filming a Tik Tok.

I left the desk and got myself some coffee.

What I mean to say, please don't film your Tik Tok on your balcony, and certainly don't film it while standing on top of a chair that's also on your balcony. You may give whoever is secretly staring at you a very stressful time.

# Lily

Hey, let's talk about Lily, shall we?

Before I start, I should make this clear first. I did not come out with the idea of Lily. Instead, PYKAMIA, our musician, suggested the character idea to me. However, I did change the character quite a bit, including her personalities and her outside looks.

Here's some first drafts of Lily.

![1st Iteration](1.png)

^ This is the first draft. We were probably deciding on her clothings.

![2nd Iteration](2.png)

^ The second iteration. I think I mentioned "Lily is also a teacher to the main character," and that's why the artist made her look like a saint (?) or an elf in this design.

![3rd Iteration](3.png)

^ The third iteration. Now she is starting to look like her current self.

I am not an artist, and certainly not a character designer. However, when I ask for a character, I usually want a visual motif: something that you can look at, and you will be reminded of the character immediately. For Lily, I decided her motifs would be her red glasses and her red cravat (bow tie).

![4th Iteration](4.png)
^ That's why I ask the artist to make her red bow tie larger.

From the very start, one thing has been certain: Lily is __cute__, not __sexy__. She's cute in a dorky, little sister's kind of way. However, she is also wise, and would provide important guidance to the main character when needed, which is very often because he is honestly sometimes so pessimistic, it's borderline depression symptoms. The story needs someone who can shine through his sad nature.

That is to say, the last detail is about increasing her cuteness.

![5th Iteration](5.png)

^ I must have thought getting rid of the long white tights helps increasing her cuteness. Though looking back, I am not sure why I thought that.

![6th Iteration](6.png)

^ Another design with black tights. This one I know for certain was because I thought black tights would make her "sexy," which was not what we were going for.

Anyway, this is how we arrive at the final design.

![Final Iteration](final.png)

^ Yippeee

I don't think I explicitly ever mentioned this to the artists, but the following artists all caught on with the red glasses and the bow tie, which makes me very satisfied.

I think most other characters also have some visual gags like these. I will talk about them when the time comes!
