# Life Update
I have been playing The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- recently. I refrain from talking about the game's quality because I don't want to influence your willingness to play the game. However, during one play session, I accidently loaded an old save instead of saving my current playthrough, so I lost hours of progress.

(I may have cried a little bit.)

Why does the Load screen look exactly the same as the Save screen? UI designers worldwide, it's time to differentiate your Save and Load screens! The two menus that serve the exact opposite functionalities can not look the same! Color-tint them or whatever!

# "Lily Power"
I have been thinking this to myself for a fairly long time now. Lily Fantasia's gameplay is done, the presentation of the story is done, but it really lacks a long term progression system. I think it can benefit with a long term progression system so it can be more "structured" and create a somehow rigid path for the players to follow.

Sometimes having a path to follow makes it easier to reach the end. Or even better, see what's behind it.

After working through the whole weekend (please refer to my introduction where I said I have no life and no friend), let me introduce "Lily Power!" (*name may change in the future, patent in process)

Now, when you finish playing a song, you would gain an amount of "Lily Power." The amount of Lily Power you get would depend on how well you played, along with some mysterious factors!

^ I got 128 Lily Power from playing the song!

I know I said the factors are mysterious. However, let me say this: you will get bonus Lily Power if this is the first time you played a song, and you will get a bonus. Also, no matter how bad you play, you will still get some Lily Power! In other words, please explore new songs, and don't be afraid to try out hard songs too!

# What can you do with Lily Power?
In short, there are main 3 ways to use your Lily Power.

First of all, there may be some songs in Lily's Practice Room that may be locked first, which you would need Lily Power to unlock.

Secondly, you will need some Lily Power to progress through the story. Aka, you will need Lily Power to unlock new stories.

Lastly, perhaps most excitingly, you can also use Lily Power to unlock bonus content, such as unlocking bonus arts!

(and maybe other things, I have not decided yet!)

*ps, since the stories are now locked, you will need to unlock them again even if you have played through them. I am sorry!

# When will this update come out?
Obviously this would be a fairly big update to the demo. I really want to push it around the mid of May. There will be more news when this update is released!
