# Life Update
Usually I would write something witty and satirical here, so you know I am a very cool person who is mysterious yet charming, but honestly? There is nothing to write about this time. Nothing interesting has happened. I don't even have time to enjoy the books I bought, and yet I feel like I have gotten nothing done. It is a terrible feeling.

# Lily Fantasia
I am very tired when I was writing this (I have not slept for 36 hours and I don't even know what I am doing), so I will just post some screenshots and call it a day......it's going to be even sadder that this is probably going to be more interesting than the technical posts I have spent hours writing, but this is just life isn't it?

^ I did not stop making new features for the Story Book since last week. What make you think I would stop just there?

^ I always thought Lily needs a new posture during battle. And so she gets one. Now you know she is a conductor.

^ Flowers will bloom.

^ There are some new features in the Song Selection Menu too.

# Conclusion
The Ego must integrate the Shadow to become closer to the Self man idk whatelse I can say.
